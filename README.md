# Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space

Keras implementation of LSTM variational autoencoder based on the code 
in [twairball's repo](https://github.com/twairball/keras_lstm_vae). Totally rewritten. Doesn't follow the paper exactly,
but the main ideas are implemented.

## Quick start

To run a toy example, download [this small dataset](http://www.manythings.org/anki/fra-eng.zip) and 
unpack `fra.txt` into the the folder `./data/`. Then run
```bash
    $ python3 train.py
```

Travelling the space: 

```
    1000 samples, 40 epochs, toy example: train data
    ==  	 i 'm lucky . 	 	 ==
    1.00	 i 'm lucky 
    0.83	 i 'm lucky 
    0.67	 i 'm tough 
    0.50	 i 'm well 
    0.33	 i won . 
    0.17	 go calm 
    0.00	 slow down 
    ==  	 slow down . 	 	 	 ==
    
    3000 samples, 40 epochs, toy example: train data
    ==  	 it was long . 	 	 	 ==
    1.00	 it was long 
    0.83	 it was long 
    0.67	 it was new 
    0.50	 it was new 
    0.33	 it was wrong 
    0.17	 is that 
    0.00	 is that 
    ==  	 is that so ? 	 	 	 ==
    
    ==  	 i was ready . 	 	 	 ==
    1.00	 i was ready 
    0.83	 i was ready 
    0.67	 do n't die 
    0.50	 do n't die 
    0.33	 do n't lie 
    0.17	 he is here 
    0.00	 he is here 
    ==  	 he is here ! 	 	 	 ==
    
    ==  	 i feel cold . 	 	 	 ==
    1.00	 i feel cold 
    0.83	 i feel cold 
    0.67	 i feel . 
    0.50	 feel this 
    0.33	 bring wine 
    0.17	 say goodbye 
    0.00	 say goodbye 
    ==  	 say goodbye . 	 	 	 	 ==
